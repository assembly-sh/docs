## Creating an Organization

Once logged in, you land on your **personal account** page.
Here's where you can manage your personal information, change your password, and create a new project **for your personal use**.

To invite other users and collaborate on a project, you need to create an organization.
In the top left corner you always find a menu that lets you switch between different organizations or create a new one.

After clicking **Create organization**, you are prompted to enter the name of the new organization and its URL.
And that's it! You have successfully created a new organization.

You are now ready to [create your first project](/getting-started/project-settings)!
