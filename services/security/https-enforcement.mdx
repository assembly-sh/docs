Securing your website by enforcing HTTPS is crucial in todayâ€™s digital landscape.
HTTPS enforcement on Edgee ensures that all incoming connections are secure, providing a safe environment for both users and data.

By activating this feature, Edgee redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, leveraging HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
to prevent protocol downgrade attacks and protect against cookie hijacking. This not only secures the data transmitted between
your users and your application but also boosts your SEO rankings and builds user trust.

Enabling HTTPS enforcement is straightforward: a simple toggle within your project's security settings
instantly enhances the security posture of your entire application.
