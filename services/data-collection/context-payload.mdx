The **Context Payload** is a powerful feature, providing you with fine-grained control over the data sent to various analytics. This guide will walk 
you through the essentials of crafting a **Context Payload** to enhance your data collection strategy.

## Introduction to Context Payload

A **Context Payload** is a structured data format used to define and send detailed information about user interactions, 
page characteristics, and more, directly within your HTML page. By including a **Context Payload**, you can instruct Edgee on exactly what data 
to collect, how to process it, and where to send it.

## Inserting a Context Payload in your application

The way you insert a **Context Payload** in your application depends on the [Edgee SDK](/getting-started/sdk) you're using.
For HTML applications you can manually insert the **Context Payload** within a `<script>` tag with `type="application/json"` and a specific ID. 

For React applications, you can use the `EdgeeContextPayload` component from the `react-edgee` package.

<CodeGroup>

```html HTML page
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
  {
    // ...YOUR_CONTEXT_PAYLOAD...
  }
</script>
```

```jsx ReactJS page
// import the necessary components
import { EdgeeContextPayload, EdgeeContextObject } from "react-edgee";

// declare your context payload object
const edgeeContextPayload: EdgeeContextObject = {
  // ...YOUR_CONTEXT_PAYLOAD...
};

// add the EdgeeContextPayload component where you want to render it
return (
  <EdgeeContextPayload data={edgeeContextPayload} />
);
}
```
</CodeGroup>


<Note>You can place your **Context Payload** anywhere in your page, but it's recommended to include it before the Edgee SDK for optimal performance.</Note>

## Structure of a Context Payload

Here's a breakdown of the key parts of a typical **Context Payload**:

```json
{
    "page": {
        "name": "With Edgee",
        "category": "demo",
        "title": "With Edgee",
        "url": "https://www.edgee.dev/demo/with-edgee.html",
        "path": "/demo/with-edgee.html",
        "search": "?ok",
        "keywords": ["demo", "tag manager", "edgee"],
        "properties": {
            "section": "political",
            "pv": 1
        }
    },
    "identify": {
        "userId": "12345",
        "anonymousId": "12345",
        "properties": {
            "email": "me@example.com",
            "name": "John Doe"
        }
    },
    "destinations": {
        "all": true,
        "google_analytics": true,
        "amplitude": true,
        "facebook_capi": true
    }
}
```

### Context Payload fields breakdown

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`page` | Object | Defines attributes related to the current page view, including metadata such as page name, category, and specific properties for enhanced data collection.
`identify` | Object | Contains user identification information, crucial for personalizing user experience and tracking user data across sessions.
`destinations` | Object | Specifies which analytics or marketing platforms should receive the data. This enables targeted data transmission based on your configuration.


Let's have a look at each object individually.

#### The `page` object

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`name` | String | The name of the page
`category` | String | The category of the page
`title` | String | The title of the page
`url` | String | The full url of the page, with scheme, host, path, and search
`path` | String | The path of the page
`search` | String | The search query of the page
`keywords` | Array | The keywords associated with the page
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the page

#### The `identify` object

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`userId` | String | A unique identifier for the user, typically from your own user database.
`anonymousId` | String | An alternative identifier used when a `userId` is not available, ensuring that user actions can still be collected anonymously.
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the user

[Learn more about the identify event here](/services/data-collection/identify-event).


#### The `destinations` object

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`All` | Boolean | Even if you don't define this field, it will be set to `true` by default. But if you set it to `false`, no destination will receive the data.
`DestinationName` | Boolean | If `true`, the specified destination will receive the data. If `false`, the destination will not receive the data.

Use the `destinations` object to specify which analytics components **should and should not** receive the data. If you do not specify any destinations, 
all configured destinations will receive the data by default.

For example, let's say you have three destinations configured: Google Analytics, Amplitude, and Facebook Conversions API. 
To exclude Google Analytics from receiving the data, you can set the `google_analytics` field to `false`:

```json
{
    "destinations": {
        "google_analytics": false
    }
}
```

If you only want to send data to Google Analytics, you can set the `All` field to `false` and the `Google Analytics` field to `true`:
```json
{
    "destinations": {
        "all": false,
        "google_analytics": true
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Precision and Clarity**: Ensure that each field in the payload is accurately defined. Clear, descriptive values for page names, categories, and properties enhance data quality.
- **Consent and Privacy**: When including any personally identifiable information (PII) in the `identify` section, ensure you have obtained explicit consent from the user in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your **Context Payload** up to date with any changes in your site structure, user attributes, or analytics destinations to maintain data accuracy and relevance.
