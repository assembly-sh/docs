The `identify` event is a fundamental aspect of user analytics, enabling you to connect users to their actions and 
capture essential properties about them. This documentation provides detailed guidance on utilizing the `identify` event to enrich 
your user data for more personalized and insightful analytics.

First of all, you don't need to fire an `identify` event for every user action. Instead, you should fire it when 
you first learn about a user, and then update the user's information as it changes (for example, when they update their profile, or when they first register).

## Event fields

The `identify` event collects the following fields about the user:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`userId` | String | A unique identifier for the user, typically from your own user database.
`anonymousId` | String | An alternative identifier used when a `userId` is not available, ensuring that user actions can still be collected anonymously.
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the user

<Warning>
  **Privacy Notice**:
  This method and all the fields it collects are subject to data privacy regulations.
  When collecting user data, always prioritize user privacy and data protection.
  Ensure that you are compliant with relevant data privacy regulations and obtain user consent before collecting any personal information.

## How to collect the `identify` event?

There are two ways to collect the `identify` event:

### 1 - Automatically with the **Context Payload**

Edgee collects the `identify` event automatically each time it receives a **Context Payload** with the `identify` field.
Here's a breakdown of how to structure the **Context Payload**:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
    {
        "page": {
            "name": "With Edgee",
            ...
        },
        "identify": {
            "userId": "abcde",
            "anonymousId": "12345",
            "properties": {
              "email": "me@example.com",
              "name": "John Doe"
            }
        },
        "destinations": {
            "all": false,
            "bigquery": true
        }
    }
</script>
```

### 2 - Manually 

The `identify` event can be collected manually by calling the `edgee.identify()` method via the Edgee SDK.
Here's a breakdown of how to structure an `identify` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.identify(identifyObj, destinations);
edgee.identify({
    "userId": "abcde",
    "anonymousId": "12345",
    "properties": {
      "email": "me@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
}, {
    "All": false,
    "BigQuery": true
});
```

As usual, you can optionally specify the destinations where the event should be sent. If the destinations parameter is not
specified, Edgee will look at the **Context Payload**. If not, the event will be sent to all your destinations.

The `edgee.identify()` method expect two optionals parameters:

field |    | type | description
--- | -- |--- | ---
`identifyObj` | _optional_ | object\|String | A free-form dictionary object containing details of the `identify` event. This object can include all the following optional fields: `userId`, `anonymoudId`, and `properties`. You can also provide a string that will be used as the `userId` field.
`destinations` | _optional_ | object | Specifies which analytics components should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured components within the Edgee platform.


## Best Practices for `identify` Events

- **Consistent Identification**: Use consistent identifiers across your application to ensure accurate user tracking. Decide on a standard for when to use `userId` versus `anonymousId` and stick to it.
- **Relevant Properties**: Only include properties that offer actionable insights. Avoid collecting sensitive or unnecessary information to maintain data integrity.
- **Selective Destination Sending**: Utilize the destinations parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure that you are compliant with relevant data privacy regulations when collecting user data. Always prioritize user consent and data protection.
