With *Data Collection*, you can run your current analytics solution at the edge, 100% privacy-friendly, and without any data loss,
whether it's **Google Analytics**, **Amplitude** or any other analytics tool, and even if it's your own first party analytics solution.

## How to enable data collection?

After [creating your project](/getting-started/project-settings) and [adding the Edgee SDK to your website](/getting-started/sdk), Edgee will start capturing all the analytics events at the edge.

First, enable the analytics component for your project by visiting the **Data Collection** panel on your project page, and click **Add a Component**. 
Then select one of the available components and configure it.

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Data Collection, then add your first component.">
  <img
    src="/images/data-collection-catalog.png"
    alt="Add your analytics SDK to Edgee and start capturing events at the edge."
    align={"center"}
  />
</Frame>

## How does it work?

Edgee intercepts the HTTP responses from your backend, and **looks for the SDK instructions** you've configured. 
Then we trigger the analytics events directly at the edge, without having to wait for the client to execute any code.

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/instructions-dark.png"/>


The first instruction is the presence of the SDK itself:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="<YOUR_SDK_URL>" async></script>
```

Or in React:

```jsx {1,8}
import EdgeeSdk from "react-edgee";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Your page title</title>
        <EdgeeSdk src={"<YOUR_SDK_URL>"} />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Remember: the Edgee proxy integrates with the analytics provider only when the Edgee SDK is detected on your pages (_except for the security services that run on each request_).

Once the SDK is added, Edgee automatically captures `page` events (pageview) at the edge.

In the [next section](/services/data-collection/page-event) we'll see how to manage the `page` event, and how to manually trigger other events using Edgee SDK.


## Bots

Unlike server-side analytics technology, Edgee is able to detect bots thanks to a proprietary challenge mechanism. 
Our strength lies in being present at the edge, but also on the client side, thanks to our SDK.
This enables us to collect only data from real humans.
