Edgee provides a flexible consent management system that allows you to control data collection and anonymization based on user consent status.


## Declare the consent status with the JavaScript SDK

You can set the user's consent status using the `edgee.consent()` method:

```javascript
// Set consent to denied
edgee.consent("denied")
// Set consent to pending
edgee.consent("pending")
// Set consent to granted
edgee.consent("granted")
```


## Declare the consent status with the Data Layer

Alternatively, you can set the initial consent status using the Edgee data layer:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
    "data_collection": {
        "consent": "granted"
    }
}
</script>
```

<Note>When user consent status is set, Edgee stores and uses it for every subsequent event.</Note>


## Consent States

There are three possible consent states:

- `pending`: Initial state when user hasn't made a choice yet
- `denied`: User has explicitly denied consent
- `granted`: User has explicitly granted consent

## Default Consent

If no consent is explicitly set:
- The default consent state is `pending`
- Or, you can configure the default consent state for each component in the Edgee Console

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Data Collection > Your component, then configure the default consent status.">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/default-consent-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/default-consent-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

## Data Anonymization

The consent status affects how Edgee handles user data:

1. When consent is `granted`:
   - Data anonymization is disabled
   - Full user data is collected and forwarded to components

2. When consent is `pending` or `denied`:
   - Data anonymization is enabled by default
   - Sensitive user data is anonymized before being forwarded (see [Privacy Documentation](/services/data-collection/privacy))
   - But you can override this behavior by clicking on `Anonymization` button in the component configuration.

## What do components with consent status do?

Each component can have different behavior based on the consent status. Some components will simply do nothing with it, 
and some will adapt their rules. 
For example, the **Piano Analytics** component will activate an "exempt" mode when consent is denied or pending. 
**Google Analytics** will change some of its query parameters (for example, `npa` to `1` and `gcs` to `G101`) when consent is denied or pending.

To know more about how each component works with consent status, please refer to each component's documentation.

## Best Practices

1. Always set explicit consent based on user choice
2. Configure appropriate default consent for each component
3. Only disable anonymization when absolutely necessary
4. Review privacy implications when changing consent settings
5. Document consent collection in your privacy policy
