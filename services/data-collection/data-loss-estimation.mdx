title: Data Loss Estimation
description: Learn how we estimate data loss on your website in minutes
---

Edgee provides a [tool](https://www.edgee.cloud/#data-collection-form) to help you understand data collection 
roadblocks on your website and estimate the impact of these barriers on your data analytics efforts. 

By analyzing your web pages, we provide detailed insights into how data loss can occur due to 
user consent requirements, adblockers, and client-side performance issues.

## How It Works

Our tool takes a URL input and launches a special crawler that simulates user interactions 
and observes all data collection requests initiated by the page within the browser environment.


1. **Input URL**: provide the URL of the webpage you wish to analyze.
2. **Crawling**: We crawl the webpage and simulate standard user interactions to trigger data collection requests.
3. **Request Analysis**: For each data request, the tool assesses potential obstacles that might prevent the data from being collected successfully.

## Data Loss Correspondence Table

Based on extensive studies with our customers, we have developed a correspondence table that quantifies 
the expected data loss associated with each type of obstacle. This table is used to provide:

- **Estimated Data Loss**: For each type of data collection request, the tool estimates potential data loss percentages.
- **Average Data Loss**: We calculate an average data loss based on the types and frequencies of obstacles encountered on the webpage.

## Estimating Data Loss for Loyal Users

<img className="block" src="/images/loyal-user-toggle.png" alt="Loyal users" width={200} />

With our tool you can also take into consideration the behavior of loyal users - those with more than four sessions per day - and 
estimate data loss specifically for this user segment. The rationale is that loyal users, due to 
their frequent interactions with the site, are more likely to encounter and potentially activate 
those obstacles, leading to higher risks of data loss.

## How to use the tool

- **Access**: The Data Loss Estimation Tool is available through the Edgee homepage.
- **Report**: After analysis, the tool provides a comprehensive report detailing each detected obstacle, the potential data loss, 
and recommendations for mitigating these losses.

This tool is invaluable for businesses looking to optimize their data collection strategies, enhance user engagement, 
and improve overall data accuracy. By understanding and addressing the potential roadblocks to effective data collection, 
companies can make informed decisions to adapt their analytics practices and achieve better outcomes.
