The **Data Layer** is a powerful feature, providing you with fine-grained control over the data sent to various analytics. This guide will walk 
you through the essentials of crafting a **Data Layer** to enhance your data collection strategy.

## Introduction to Edgee Data Layer

A **Data Layer** is a structured data format used to define and send detailed information about user interactions, 
page characteristics, and more, directly within your HTML page. By including a **Data Layer**, you can instruct Edgee on exactly what data 
to collect, how to process it, and where to send it.

## Inserting an Edgee Data Layer in your application

The way you insert a **Data Layer** in your application depends on the [Edgee SDK](/getting-started/sdk) you're using.
For HTML applications you can manually insert the **Data Layer** within a `<script>` tag with `type="application/json"` and a specific ID. 

For React applications, you can use the `EdgeeDataLayer` component from the `react-edgee` package.

<CodeGroup>

```html HTML page
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
  {
    // ...YOUR_DATA_LAYER...
  }
</script>
```

```jsx ReactJS page
// import the necessary components
import { EdgeeDataLayer, EdgeeContextObject } from "react-edgee";

// declare your data layer object
const edgeeDataLayer: EdgeeDataLayer = {
  // ...YOUR_DATA_LAYER...
};

// add the EdgeeDataLayer component where you want to render it
return (
  <EdgeeDataLayer data={edgeeDataLayer} />
);
}
```
</CodeGroup>


<Note>You can place your **Data Layer** anywhere in your page, but it's recommended to include it before the Edgee SDK for optimal performance.</Note>

## Structure of a Data Layer object

Here's a breakdown of the key parts of a typical **Data Layer**:

```json
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",
        "data": {
            "name": "With Edgee",
            "category": "demo",
            "title": "With Edgee",
            "url": "https://demo.edgee.app/with-edgee.html",

            }
        },
        "components": {
            "all": false,
            "google_analytics": true
        }
      },

              "name": "John Doe"
            }
        }
      }
    ],
    "context": {
        "page": {
            "name": "With Edgee",
            "category": "demo",
            "title": "With Edgee",
            "url": "https://demo.edgee.app/with-edgee.html",

    "components": {

### Data Layer fields breakdown

The following fields are defined under `data_collection`:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`events` | Array | Contains a list of events
`context` | Object | Contains general information that can be used for all events
`components` | Object | Specifies which components should receive the data. This enables targeted data transmission based on your configuration.


Let's have a look at each field individually.

#### The `events` list 

It contains objects with the following structure.

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`type` | String | The type of event: `page`, `track`, or `user`
`data` | Object | The event data that depends on each event type
`components` | Object | Specifies which components should receive the data.

Learn more about the [page](/services/data-collection/page-event), [track](/services/data-collection/track-event),
and [user](/services/data-collection/user-event) event types and their structure.


#### The `context` object

It can contain the following fields.

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`page` | Object | General info about this page that can be used across events
`user` | Object | General info about the user that can be used across events

<Note>
Note: when you define context data about the current `page` or `user`, it's going to be used automatically
for all compatible events, so you don't need to provide the same information multiple times.
</Note>


#### The `components` object

It can contain the following fields.

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`all` | Boolean | Even if you don't define this field, it will be set to `true` by default. But if you set it to `false`, no destination will receive the data.
`<component_name>` | Boolean | If `true`, the specified destination will receive the data. If `false`, the destination will not receive the data.

Use the `components` object to specify which analytics components **should and should not** receive the data. If you do not specify any component, 
all configured components will receive the data by default.

For example, let's say you have three components configured: Google Analytics, Amplitude, and Facebook Conversions API. 
To exclude Google Analytics from receiving the data, you can set the `google_analytics` field to `false`:

```json
{
    "components": {
        "google_analytics": false
    }
}
```

If you only want to send data to Google Analytics, you can set the `All` field to `false` and the `Google Analytics` field to `true`:
```json
{
    "components": {
        "all": false,
        "google_analytics": true
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Precision and Clarity**: Ensure that each field in the data layer is accurately defined. Clear, descriptive values for page names, categories, and properties enhance data quality.
- **Consent and Privacy**: When including any personally identifiable information (PII) in the `identify` section, ensure you have obtained explicit consent from the user in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your **Data Layer** up to date with any changes in your site structure, user attributes, or analytics components to maintain data accuracy and relevance.
