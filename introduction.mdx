Assembly.sh offers developers tools and services that complement cloud computing, enabling their 
applications to interact at the network layer (edge). This allows the offloading of resource-intensive tasks, 
traditionally handled by devices, to the edge, including analytics, A/B testing, web performance optimization, 
content stitching, and more.


## What's Edge Computing?


In the era of data explosion, edge computing is the next frontier. It moves computation from devices and 
traditional data centers to the 'edge', closer to where data is generated and used. This results in faster 
data processing, reduced network congestion, and enhanced application performance.

## Why Assembly.sh?

Assembly.sh is a platform that enables developers to build and deploy edge applications. It provides a
suite of tools and services that complement cloud computing, enabling applications to interact at the network
layer (edge). This allows the offloading of resource-intensive tasks, traditionally handled by devices, to the
edge, including analytics, A/B testing, web performance optimization, content stitching, and more.
