Segment's powerful customer data platform is now fully integrable with Edgee, allowing you to centralize your data collection 
and analytics seamlessly at the edge. This component eliminates the need to embed Segment's script directly on your website, 
significantly improving site performance and adhering to strict privacy standards.

<Note>
  Segment component accepts `page`, `identify`, and `track` events.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Segment with your project on Edgee:**

1. Log in first to your Segment account and create a new source for your project. ðŸš¨**WARNING** Your source has to be a `HTTP API` source.
2. Copy the `Write Key` from the Segment dashboard.
3. Log into your Edgee console and navigate to the Data Collection service within your project.
4. Select "Add Destination" and pick "Segment" from the list of available analytics components.
5. With this setup, you're ready to transmit events directly to Segment, leveraging the edge's power for your analytics.

## Destination Name

When configuring your **Edgee Data Layer** or making SDK calls, use "segment" as the component name to ensure your data is correctly routed.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "segment": true
  }
}
```
