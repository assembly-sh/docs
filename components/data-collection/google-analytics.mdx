Google Analytics 4 is now available at the edge. This means you can use Google Analytics 4 without 
having to load the Google Analytics 4 script on your website. This is a huge win for privacy and performance.

<Note>
  Google Analytics component accepts `page`, `identify`, and `track` events.
</Note>

## Getting Started

<Warning>
  Google Analytics 4 supports server-to-server integration via its Measurement Protocol API. 
  Edgee monitors the capabilities of the Measurement Protocol API and regularly updates the GA component to propose the best level of reporting.
</Warning>

**To add Google Analytics to your project:**

1. From the Edgee console, go to your project and go to the Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Destination" and choose "Google Analytics".
3. Enter the `Measurement ID` and the `API Secret` associated with your GA4 stream and click Save. <br />
_(To create a new API Secret, navigate in the Google Analytics UI to Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create)_
4. You can now start sending events to Google Analytics.

## Destination name

When specifying the destination in the **Edgee Data Layer** or using SDK methods, please use `google_analytics` as the component name.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "google_analytics": true
  }
}
```
