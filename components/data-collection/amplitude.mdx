Amplitude, a comprehensive product analytics platform, is seamlessly integrated with Edgee, allowing you to leverage 
its robust analytics capabilities directly from the edge. This component bypasses the need for embedding Amplitude's SDK directly into your site, 
offering significant improvements in privacy and website performance.

Edgee uses Amplitude's HTTP API to send events directly to Amplitude, ensuring secure and direct data transmission from the edge to Amplitude.

<Note>
  Amplitude component accepts `page`, `identify`, and `track` events.
