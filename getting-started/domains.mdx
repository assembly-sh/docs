Each project is associated with an Edgee-owned domain under `*.edgee.app`.

Your default domain is `your-project-id.edgee.app` and it allows you to get started with Edgee quickly,
without worrying about TLS certificates or infrastructural integrations with your existing architecture.

In many cases, you'll need to create a custom domain so that Edgee handles all requests routed to your website,
such as `my-website.com`.

## Create a new domain

Browse to your project's **Settings** panel and select **Domains**.

Here, click **Add domain** on the top right.

    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/domains-create.png"
        alt="How to create a new domain"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/domains-create-dark.png"
        alt="How to create a new domain"
    />
</Frame>

Now simply enter your domain, such as `my-website.com`.

There's no need to select a protocol or any other detail for now.

<Frame caption="Enter the domain name. Click on the image to zoom in.">
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/domains-new.png"
        alt="Enter the domain name"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/domains-new-dark.png"
        alt="Enter the domain name"
    />
</Frame>

That's it! Click **Save** and let's more forward with the configuration.

## DNS validation

The next step involves proving that you control the DNS for your domain name
by putting a specific value in a `CNAME` or `TXT` record such as `_acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`.

This is a standard procedures and ensures that only verified domain owners can configure new domains on Edgee.

We're working hard to automate this step for you. In the meantime, please [reach out to Edgee support](mailto:support@edgee.cloud)
to request your DNS challenge record value.

## SSL certificate

If you want Edgee to be the first entry point to your website, we'll need to configure a proper SSL/TLS certificate as well.

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and an SSL certificate allows Edgee to encrypt and secure communications
between your visitors and your website, making sure your traffic is served via HTTPS.

Here you have two options:

1. Use a default [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificate that we can generate automatically
2. Provide a custom certificate

We highly recommend option 1 because it simplifies and speeds up the procedure.

Similar to DNS validation, we're working hard to automate this step for you. 
In the meantime, please [reach out to Edgee support](mailto:support@edgee.cloud)
to request a new SSL certificate or provide a custom one.
