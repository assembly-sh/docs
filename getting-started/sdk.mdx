<EdgeeSdk />

Getting up and runing with the Edgee SDK only takes a few minutes.

### **Hold on a second!** ðŸ¤”

You might wonder - If Edgee processes everything at the edge, why do I need a client-side SDK?

Great question! This SDK acts as a bridge and replaces the SDKs of all the components you've enabled for your project.
The SDK allows our edge processing capabilities to kick in. 
When the Edgee proxy intercepts this script, it triggers analytics events and other services directly at the edge. 
This means **you get real-time processing without compromising your application's performance**.
Plus, the SDK lets you track client-side events such as button clicks or custom actions without reloading the page,
communicating directly with the Edgee proxy so it can't be blocked.


<Note>Note: once Edgee is deployed in front of your website, it will automatically
convert the SDK into an inline `<script>` to improve performance
and to make sure that all client-side events are collected successfully.</Note>

### SDK integrations

We provide SDKs for different frameworks and libraries. 

Choose the one that fits your project:

### Good to know: Testing Edgee locally

To test Edgee locally, you have two options:

1. Integrate the SDK of your project in your local environment and... that's it! With this simple step, the SDK will run only client-side,
so you won't benefit from Edgee's edge processing capabilities. But it's a good way to test your application's behavior with the SDK.

2. Integrate the SDK **AND** install Edgee open-source proxy on your local machine. This way, you can test the full capabilities of Edgee, including edge processing.
To do this, follow the instructions in the [Edgee open-source repository](/open-source/overview)
