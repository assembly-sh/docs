For applications built with React, we provide a dedicated library to simplify the integration of our SDK. 
This library ensures that Edgee's services are seamlessly integrated and that page views are tracked accurately during single-page navigations.

## Installation

You can install the `react-edgee` library using npm or yarn.

Using npm:

```bash
npm install react-edgee
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-edgee
```

## Usage

Import the `EdgeeSdk` component from the `react-edgee` library:

```js
import EdgeeSdk from 'react-edgee';
```

#### When using `app` folder structure

Add the `EdgeeSdk` component inside the `<body>` tag of your `RootLayout` component:

```js
import EdgeeSdk from "react-edgee";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <EdgeeSdk src={"<YOUR_SDK_URL>"} />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_SDK_URL>` with the URL provided in the Edgee console, in the project overview section.


#### When using `pages` folder structure

Add the `EdgeeSdk` component in your `MyApp` component:

```js
import EdgeeSdk from 'react-edgee';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <EdgeeSdk src="<YOUR_SDK_URL>" />
    </>
  );
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_SDK_URL>` with the URL provided in the Edgee console, in the project overview section.

#### When using Vite or other frameworks

Add the `EdgeeSdk` component inside the `<Router>` component in your `App` component:

```js
import EdgeeSdk from 'react-edgee';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Router>
        <EdgeeSdk src="<YOUR_SDK_URL>" />
        <Routes>
          {/* Your Routes Here */}
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Replace `<YOUR_SDK_URL>` with the URL provided in the Edgee console, in the project overview section.
