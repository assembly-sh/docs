# How to install Edgee

Once you have a valid configuration file (see next section), you can run Edgee in different ways, 
using the installer, Docker or running as a Rust crate.

<CodeGroup>
```shell Installer script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.edgee.cloud | sh
[...]
$ ./edgee
```

```shell docker CLI
docker run \
  -v $PWD/edgee.toml:/app/edgee.toml \
  -v $PWD/cert:/var/edgee/cert \
  -v $PWD/wasm:/var/edgee/wasm \
  -p80:80 \
  -p443:443 \
  edgeeecloud/edgee
```

```yaml docker-compose.yml
service:
  edgee:
    image: edgeecloud/edgee
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "./edgee.toml:/app/edgee.toml"
      - "./cert:/var/edgee/cert"
      - "./wasm:/var/edgee/wasm"
```

```shell cargo CLI
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```
</CodeGroup>

# Configuration


Edgee proxy is customized through the `edgee.toml` file, which is expected to be present in the same directory where edgee is running from.

Here's a minimal configuration sample. The configuration sets Edgee to work as a regular reverse proxy. Later  we'll see how to enable edge components.

```toml edgee.toml
[log]
level = "warn"

[monitor]
address = "0.0.0.0:8222"

[http]
address = "0.0.0.0:80"
force_https = true

[https]
address = "0.0.0.0:80"
cert = "/var/edgee/cert/server.pem"
key = "/var/edgee/cert/edgee.key"

[[routing]]
domain = "demo.edgee.dev"

[[routing.backends]]
name = "demo"
default = true
address = "192.168.0.10"
enable_ssl = true
```

### Log levels
Edgee allows you to control the granularity of logs you want to be displayed. The possible values are:
`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. This setting defines the minimal level to
be displayed, so setting it to `warn` will show `warn`, `error`, and `fatal` messages while hidding the others.

### Monitoring
The **monitor** entry point exposes the monitoring and observability features. We plan to implement support for
the popular observability frameworks in the future. For now it only exposts the `/healthz` HTTP endpoint to 
be used for health checking.

### Routing
The example above sets up one backend called "demo".
As the default backend, it will receive all traffic directed to `demo.edgee.dev`.
Additionaly, projects can have a number of backends and use routing rules to distribute traffic among them.

For example, we could add a second backend called "api" to handle all requests to `demo.edgee.dev/api`:

```toml edgee.toml
[[routing.rules]]
path_prefix = "/api/"
backend = "api"

[[routing.backends]]
name = "api"
enable_ssl = true
address = "192.168.0.30"
```

The supported matchers are:
- *path*: the path matches exactly the provided value
- *path_prefix*: the path starts with the provided value
- *path_regexp*: the path matches the provided regexp

In addition to proxying the request, you could also rewrite the path:

```toml edgee.toml

[[routing.rules]]
path_prefix = "/api/"
rewrite = "/v1/"
backend = "api"
```

## Integrating with edgee components

Check out the [official components docs](/components/overview) to dive into the components architecture.

In this example we're gonna implement data collection using the [amplitude component](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/amplitude-component).

The Edgee proxy is designed for performance and extensibility, so you can easily integrate open source components based on the platforms you need. 
Here's a list of the components we've built so far:
- [Amplitude](/components/data-collection/amplitude)
- [Google Analytics](/components/data-collection/google-analytics)
- [Segment](/components/data-collection/segment)

You just need point to the WebAssembly implementation in your proxy configuration.
You may also build your own components for integrations we don't provide yet.


### Example

Let's see how to implement data collection using Amplitude:

```toml edgee.toml
[[components.data_collection]]
name = "amplitude"
component = "/var/edgee/wasm/amplitude.wasm"
credentials.amplitude_api_key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
```
