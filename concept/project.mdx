<EdgeeSdk />

A project is a container for your edge computing workloads within Edgee. It includes your applications,
configurations, and deployments, making it easier to manage and organize your development efforts.

Each project within an organization can be configured with its unique settings, components, and access controls.
Projects allow teams to segregate and manage their edge services.
