There is two types of data collection events: incoming and outgoing. 
Edgee will store both incoming and outgoing data collection events for debugging and auditing purposes.

### The Incoming data collection events

An incoming data collection event is an event created by edgee, which will be processed and transformed into one or more outgoing data collection events by the components.

### The Outgoing data collection events

An outgoing data collection event is an event created by a component, which will be sent to the destination specified by the component.
