description: A brief introduction to your project's Data Collection API.
---

This guide will help you understand how to interact with the Data Collection API to 
collect events at the edge.

Please note that the Data Collection API is used automatically by the Edgee SDK, but could also
be used directly for other purposes, such as custom mobile integrations.


## Base URL

The data collection API is special because it is project-specific:

```
https://{PROJECT_ID}.edgee.app
```

You can find your project's ID on the [Edgee dashboard](https://www.edgee.cloud/me) under each project.
The API domain corresponds to your Edgee SDK domain:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" async src="https://{PROJECT_ID}.edgee.app/_edgee/sdk.js"></script>
```

## Authentication

The Data Collection API is meant for your client-side devices to use both for
logged-in and anonymous users, so it doesn't require any authentication.

## Errors

When an error occurs, the Edgee API responds with a conventional HTTP response code and a JSON object containing more 
details about the error. For more information, please refer to the [Errors](../errors) page.
