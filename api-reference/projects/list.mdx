### Parameters

<ResponseField name="limit" type="int" optional>
  The number of Projects to return. The default is 10.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  This is the name of your Project. It is used to filter the list of Project by name.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="organization_id" type="string">
  This is the ID of the Organization that the Project belongs to. It is used to filter the list of Project by Organization.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ending_before" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `ending_before` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 Projects, the last one (the oldest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `ending_before=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="starting_after" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `starting_after` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 Projects, the first one (the newest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `starting_after=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="order_direction" type="string">
  The order direction of the returned list. 
  
  The Projects are returned sorted by creation date. By default, the order is descending, so the most recent Projects appear first.
  Possible values are `ASC` and `DESC`. 
  Default is `DESC`.
</ResponseField>

### Response

A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of up to limit Projects. 
Passing an optional `name` will search for Projects with this name. 
Passing an optional `type` will search for Projects with this type.
Each entry in the array is a separate Project object. If no more Projects are available, the resulting array will be empty.

`has_more` property indicates whether there are more Projects available. You can use it to decide whether to show the 
user a "load more" button, for example.
