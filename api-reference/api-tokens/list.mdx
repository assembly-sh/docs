description: "Returns a list of your ApiTokens. The ApiTokens are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recent ApiTokens appearing first."
---

### Parameters

<ResponseField name="limit" type="int" optional>
  The number of ApiTokens to return. The default is 10.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  This is the name of your ApiToken. It is used to filter the list of ApiTokens by name.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ending_before" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `ending_before` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 ApiTokens, the last one (the oldest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `ending_before=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="starting_after" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `starting_after` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 ApiTokens, the first one (the newest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `starting_after=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="order_direction" type="string">
  The order direction of the returned list. 
  
  The ApiTokens are returned sorted by creation date. By default, the order is descending, so the most recent ApiTokens appear first.
  Possible values are `ASC` and `DESC`. 
  Default is `DESC`.
</ResponseField>

### Response

A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of up to limit ApiTokens, starting before ApiToken `ending_before`. 
Passing an optional `name` will search for ApiTokens with this name. 
Each entry in the array is a separate ApiToken object. If no more ApiTokens are available, the resulting array will be empty.

`has_more` property indicates whether there are more ApiTokens available. You can use it to decide whether to show the 
user a "load more" button, for example.

<RequestExample>
```bash GET /v1/api_tokens
curl -X GET 'https://api.assembly.sh/v1/api_tokens' \
